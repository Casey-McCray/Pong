# Ace Miscellaneous Sumission
The path to the executable file of the game is https://github.com/Casey-McCray/Pong/blob/master/x64/Release/Engine.exe

Made this Ping Pong game using a DirectX Framework made by ChiliTomatoNoodle.
The framework allowed me to work with pixels with basic knowledge of c++.
The code is written with OOP concepts in mind.
